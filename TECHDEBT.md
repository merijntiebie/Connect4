##TODO 
- âœ… Add lastPlayer and lastCoordinate to the play-function + tests
- âœ… Show the actual boards in play function tests
- Guardian for getPlayerColor to restrict we dont have other players than 1 and 2
- Guardian for putting disks in non-existing columns (only 0-6 should be accepted)
- ðŸ‘€ Make unit test for the different types of winning: vertical, horizontal and diagonal, for both players

- GetWinner test cases: last coordinates/player is error prone
- GetWinner test cases: extract the board into a fixture file to reduce the duplication in test case title
