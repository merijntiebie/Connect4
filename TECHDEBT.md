##TODO

- ✅ Add lastPlayer and lastCoordinate to the play-function + tests
- ✅ Show the actual boards in play function tests

- GetWinner test cases: extract the board into a fixture file to reduce the duplication in test case title
- Make it easier to create test cases by not having to create a game board by hand all the time
- Ensure that floating discs cannot happen

- Guardian for getPlayerColor to restrict we dont have other players than 1 and 2
- Guardian for putting disks in non-existing columns (only 0-6 should be accepted)
- 👀 Make unit test for the different types of winning: vertical, horizontal and diagonal, for both players

- GetWinner test cases: last coordinates/player is error prone



- Create component test for getWinner
- Extract vertical winner check to own function

- Create a generic function to check for the number of disks in the diagonal direction ✅

- Unit test output looks strange..
